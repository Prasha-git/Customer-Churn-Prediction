## Features / Highlights
- Predicts customer churn using classification models
- Visualizes key metrics and trends
- Evaluates model accuracy and performance

## Results
- Accuracy: ~85% (example)
- Confusion matrix, ROC curves, and feature importance visualizations

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo-link>`  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Open and run the notebook: `notebooks/customer_churn.ipynb`  

## Future Improvements
